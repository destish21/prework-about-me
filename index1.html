<h2>This is a section on Bass fish </h2>
<p class="dr"> Bass fish live in lakes. The word for fish in Latin is pisces </p>

<p class="ts">Fish are an important resource for humans worldwide, especially <snap class="highlight">as food. Commercial and subsistence fishers hunt fish in wild fisheries or farm them in ponds </snap>or in cages in the ocean (in aquaculture). 
    They are also caught by recreational fishers, kept as pets, raised by fishkeepers, and exhibited in public aquaria. 
    Fish have had a role in culture through the ages, serving as deities, religious symbols, and as the subjects of art, books and movies.

Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). 
Because in this manner the term "fish" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology, unless it is used in the cladistic sense, including tetrapods.[7][8] The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, 
but not a phylogenetic classification.</p>
